I am currently the principal administrator of [HighResNPS](https://highresnps.com), a crowd-sourced LC-HRMS mass spectrometry database for NPS provided by [The International Association of Forensic Toxicologists (TIAFT)](https://www.tiaft.org/).

Although my background is in analytical toxicology, having completed a PhD at the [University of Technology Sydney (UTS)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/centres/centre-forensic-science), I have since transitioned to Python development - which I really enjoy! I have experience in developing artificial intelligence models using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) libraries and applying cheminformatics using [rdkit](https://www.rdkit.org/). 

I also enjoy developing full stack applications using the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) web microframework which includes the laboratory information management system (LIMS) at the Forensic Laboratory Division, [San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner](https://www.sf.gov/departments--city-administrator--office-chief-medical-examiner).

If you're keen to learn Python or are using it in your laboratory, I'd be keen to hear more!
