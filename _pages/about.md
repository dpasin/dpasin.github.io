I am currently the principal administrator of [HighResNPS](https://highresnps.com), a crowd-sourced LC-HRMS mass spectrometry database for NPS provided by [The International Association of Forensic Toxicologists (TIAFT)](https://www.tiaft.org/).

Although my background is in analytical toxicology, having completed a PhD at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in 2018, I have since transitioned to Python development - which I really enjoy! I have experience in developing artificial intelligence models using scikit-learn and TensorFlow libraries and applying cheminformatics using rdkit. 

I also enjoy developing full stack applications using the Flask web microframework which includes the laboratory information management system (LIMS) at the Forensic Laboratory Division, San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.

If you're keen to learn Python or are using it in your laboratory, I'd be keen to hear more!
